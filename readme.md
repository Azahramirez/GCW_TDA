# GCW TDA

## Exploracion.ipynb

On this notebook the wave data is analyzed and gets transformed into the frequency domain using the FFT

## ML_Models_Fourier.ipynb

This notebook generates the persistance image of the Fourier Transform of the waves and also tries different ML methods to predict if the wave is a GW or noise only using the Fourier transform

## cnnn.ipynb

In this notebook we generate a CNN to predict whether the persistance image of the FFT of a wave is related to a GW or just noise## Beta_01.ipynbThis notebook is for generating samples of GW with a mixture of noise signals.
